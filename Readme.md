**Password Finder** this is a code kata found somewhere on the network:

You have to jump in for a presentation on a last minute call. While you are on your way to the campus where you have to give this talk, you want to rehearse the presentation. You open the Prezi app on your phone, but you forgot your password. It was Presentation something. But you remember that the last four characters are numbers and you applied the following rules:

* the digits are different
* the digits are in an increasing order
* the product of the first two is the sum of the last two.
* what is your password?
